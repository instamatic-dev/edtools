# edtools

Collection of tools for automated processing and clustering of single-crystal electron diffraction data.

Install using `pip install edtools`. Installation should take less than 20 seconds on a normal desktop.

Find the latest [releases](https://github.com/instamatic-dev/edtools/releases) for the versions that have been tested on.

[The source for this project is available here][src].

## Pipeline tools

### autoindex.py

Looks for files matching `XDS.INP` in all subdirectories and runs them using `XDS`.

	In:  XDS.INP
	Out: XDS data processing on all files

### extract_xds_info.py

Looks files matching `CORRECT.LP` in all subdirectories and extracts unit cell/integration info. Summarizes the unit cells in the excel file `cells.xlsx` and `cells.yaml`. XDS_ASCII.HKL files matching the completeness / CC(1/2) criteria are listed in `filelist.txt`. Optionally, gathers the corresponding `XDS_ASCII.HKL` files in the local directory. The `cells.yaml` file can be used as input for further processing.

	In:  CORRECT.LP
	Out: cells.yaml
	     cells.xlsx
	     filelist.txt

### find_cell.py

This program a cells.yaml file and shows histogram plots with the unit cell parameters. This program mimicks [`CELLPARM`](http://xds.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/html_doc/cellparm_program.html) and calculates the weighted mean lattice parameters, where the weight is typically the number of observed reflections (defaults to 1.0). For each lattice parameter, the mean is calculated in a given range (default range = median+-2). The range can be changed by dragging the cursor on the histogram plots.

Alternatively, the unit cells can be clustered by giving the `--cluster` command, in which a dendrogram is shown. The cluster cutoff can be selected by clicking in the dendrogram. The clusters will be written to `cells_cluster_#.yaml`.

	In:  cells.yaml
	Out: mean cell parameters
	     cells_*.yaml (clustering only)

### make_xscale.py

Prepares an input file `XSCALE.INP` for `XSCALE` and corresponding `XDSCONV.INP` for `XDSCONV`. Takes a `cells.yaml` file or a series of `XDS_ASCII.HKL` files as input, and uses those to generate the `XSCALE.INP` file.

	In:  cells.yaml / XDS_ASCII.HKL
	Out: XSCALE.INP

### cluster.py

Parses the `XSCALE.LP` file for the correlation coefficients between reflection files to perform hierarchical cluster analysis (Giordano et al., Acta Cryst. (2012). D68, 649â€“658). The cutoff threshold can be selected by clicking in the dendrogram window. The program will write new `XSCALE.LP` files to subdirectories `cluster_#`, and run `XSCALE` on them, and (if available), pointless.

	In:  XSCALE.LP
	Out: cluster_n/
		filelist.txt
		*_XDS_ASCII.HKL
		XSCALE processing
		Pointless processing
		shelx.hkl
		shelx.ins (optional)


## Helper tools

### make_shelx.py

Creates a shelx input file. Requires `sginfo` to be available on the system path to generate the SYMM/LATT cards.

	In:  cell, space group, composition
	Out: shelx.ins

Usage:

```
edtools.make_shelx -c 10.0 20.0 30.0 90.0 90.0 90.0 -s Cmmm -m Si180 O360
```

### run_pointless.py

Looks for XDS_ASCII.HKL files specified in the cells.yaml, or on the command line and runs Pointless on them.

	In:  cells.yaml / XDS_ASCII.HKL
	Out: Pointless processing

### update_xds.py

Looks files matching `CORRECT.LP` in all subdirectories, and updates the cell parameters / space group as specified.

	In:  XDS.INP
	Out: XDS.INP

Usage:

```
edtools.update_xds -c 10.0 20.0 30.0 90.0 90.0 90.0 -s Cmmm
```

### find_rotation_axis.py

Finds the rotation axis and prints out the inputs for several programs (XDS, PETS, DIALS, Instamatic, and RED). Implements the algorithm from Gorelik et al. (Introduction to ADT/ADT3D. In Uniting Electron Crystallography and Powder Diffraction (2012), 337-347). The program reads `XDS.INP` to get information about the wavelength, pixelsize, oscillation angle, and beam center, and `SPOT.XDS` (generated by COLSPOT) for the peak positions. If the `XDS.INP` file is not specified, the program will try to look for it in the current directory.

	In:  XDS.INP, SPOT.XDS
	Out: Rotation axis

Usage:

```
edtools.find_rotation_axis [XDS.INP]
```

## OS Requirement

The package has been mainly developed and tested under windows 10.

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.6+ including `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` libraries
- `sginfo` or `cctbx.python` must be available on the system path for `edtools.make_shelx`
- (Windows 10 or newer) Access to [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)
- (Windows 10 or newer) XDS and related tools must be available under WSL
